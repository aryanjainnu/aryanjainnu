### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm **Aryan Jain**, a Computer Science student at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois. I have over a year of experience as a Software Engineer at GoPomelo, APAC's Premier Google Cloud Partner, where I streamlined over 25 projects building various software solutions! 

**I'm currently working on** 
- Continuing to build a, now acquired, data-driven startup, Authentic Media Ascension
- Security Research under Prof. V.S Subrahmanian in the Northwestern NSAIL Lab where I use ML to determine CVE attacks
- Quantitative Developer Internship at Country Group Holdings, where I am designing and building a gradient-boosted decision tree algorithm
- My own Personal Portfolio Website!

**Other Technical Projects**
- [**Venmo Request Scheduler**](https://github.com/mikeluvin/venmo-scheduler) won Best Project Idea at WildHacks NU Hackathon
- [**Browser Privacy**](https://github.com/aryanjainnu/dataprivacy) is a Browser Extension that redacts sensitive text from potential social media posts
